This repo contains a set of notes that covers Day 1-4 of John Strand's Active Defense and Cyber Deception class. John Strand emphasizes that cyber deception techniques offer quick, inexpensive wins for network defense, contrary to the industry's focus on expensive security products. He demonstrates practical examples through hands-on labs, particularly focusing on host firewalls to prevent lateral movement and using Blue Spawn (a mock EDR) to test detection capabilities against various attack techniques. The class establishes the foundation for understanding how deception can provide defenders with advantages by manipulating attackers' time and efforts.

Key Takeaways Include:
1. **Cyber deception provides quick security wins**: Unlike expensive security products, cyber deception techniques can be implemented quickly and inexpensively while dramatically improving security posture by creating detection opportunities and wasting attacker time.
2. **Segment your network properly**: Implementing host-based firewalls between workstations prevents lateral movement attacks like pass-the-hash, dramatically reducing an attacker's ability to move throughout a network after compromising a single machine.
3. **Active testing is critical**: Organizations should regularly test their security products against real attack techniques using tools like Atomic Red Team to identify detection gaps. Most security products have significant blind spots that only appear during active testing.
4. **Detection time + reaction time must be less than attack time**: This formula demonstrates how cyber deception techniques work by increasing the time attackers spend on fake targets while decreasing your detection and reaction time through better alerting on those targets.
